Connected,
Beehive
This project aims to develop a connected beehive that monitors the health and activity of bees in real-time using various sensors and LoRa technology. It is an innovative solution to improve beehive management and facilitate the monitoring of environmental conditions.

Features
Indoor and Outdoor Monitoring
DHT11: Measures the temperature inside the beehive.

SHT31: Measures the outside temperature, providing a comparison of ambient conditions.

Weight Measurement
HX711: Module used to measure the beehive's weight, which allows tracking the accumulation of honey or variations in the beehive's mass.

Wireless Communication
LoRa: Technology used for sending and receiving data over long distances with low power consumption.

Dual Microcontrollers
STM32L476RG:

One microcontroller dedicated to the beehive, responsible for data collection and transmission.

One microcontroller for the control point, which receives and processes data sent via LoRa.

Real-Time Display
Two LCD Screens:

One screen displays information directly on the beehive.

One screen at the control station shows the data received via LoRa.

Hardware Used
Sensors
DHT11: Indoor temperature sensor.

SHT31: Outdoor temperature sensor.

HX711: Weight measurement module.

Communication
LoRa: For transmitting and receiving data.

Microcontrollers
Two STM32L476RG, one for the beehive and one for the control point.

Display
Two LCD screens to display information on the beehive and at the control point.
